# Dijkstra's Algorithm in PHP

## Overview
This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm in C++ to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. The algorithm calculates the minimum distance from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph.

## Features
- Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculation;
- Supports weighted, directed graphs;
- Returns the shortest distances and paths from the source node.
